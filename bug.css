The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order in which styles are applied:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#my-div {
  color: green;
}

#my-div.special-div {
  color: purple; /* This is the unexpected behavior */
}

<div id="my-div" class="special-div"></div>
```

The unexpected behavior stems from the selector `#my-div.special-div` having higher specificity than the selectors `#my-div` and `.special-div`.  This is because the ID selector (`#my-div`) has the highest specificity, and the class selector (`.special-div`) is combined, resulting in a specificity that overrides the individual `#my-div` and `.special-div` rules.  The element will end up displaying purple text instead of either green or red as one might initially assume.

This issue can be difficult to debug as it's not an immediate syntax error; the code is valid but produces an unexpected outcome.  The problem lies in misunderstanding how CSS specificity works when combining selectors with different levels of specificity.
