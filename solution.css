Several solutions can mitigate this issue. 

**Solution 1:  Embrace Specificity**
If the purple color is actually the desired outcome, no changes are needed.  The existing CSS correctly reflects the specificity rules. 

**Solution 2: Increase Specificity of the intended style**
If you intended `#my-div` or `.special-div` to take precedence, increase its specificity. This can be done by adding another more specific class or ID to the element that only this style applies to, or by adding an inline style to the element, but this is less desirable as inline styles are harder to maintain.

```css
/* Solution: Using additional classes */
#my-div {
  color: green;
}

#my-div.other-class {
  color: purple;
}
```

**Solution 3: Use !important (Generally discouraged)**
While possible, using `!important` is not best practice as it makes styles harder to maintain. 

```css
/* Not recommended, but a possible solution */
#my-div {
  color: green !important; 
}
```
Choose the solution that best fits your design and development practices. The goal is to make your CSS predictable and maintainable.
